As such, time tracking is an *essential* part of my day to day activities, and while I don't like getting *too* granular, it does look good to be able to show what you've been up to for every few hours of the day. Journaling makes this quite easy as I often make notes regarding what I'm busy with, thus I can usually just use the heading and timestamp from a journal to keep track of what I've done during the day. This also helps a lot during standups."
