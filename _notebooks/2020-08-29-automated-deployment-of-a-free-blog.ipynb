After getting some advice from a more experienced blogger, [Charl](https://cpbotha.net/), I decided to have a Hugo blog (because it's easy) hosted on Firebase (because it's free). After going through the motions I realized every time I wanted to publish a new post I'd have to go through like three or four easy steps. The thing is, that's something like 25 seconds of my life I won't get back every time I make a post. So spent a few hours automating and documenting it, for maximum efficiency.\n"
