            "content": "Why I journal . There are a few reasons I journal, let me jot them down real quick and give a brief overview of each: . time tracking | thought organization | future reference to past problems | setting and getting to the goalpost | seeing progress made | venting | . Time Tracking . Currently, I&#39;m working as a consultant. As such, time tracking is an essential part of my day to day activities, and while I don&#39;t like getting too granular, it does look good to be able to show what you&#39;ve been up to for every few hours of the day. Journaling makes this quite easy as I often make notes regarding what I&#39;m busy with, thus I can usually just use the heading and timestamp from a journal to keep track of what I&#39;ve done during the day. This also helps a lot during standups. . Thought Organization . About to go out for lunch? Make some notes of what you&#39;re busy with. Knocking off? Write down what you&#39;re leaving for yourself to do tomorrow. Going for a walk? Don&#39;t lose the flow, freeze your thoughts in text. The sheer usefulness of being able to sit down and immediately remember what I was doing and thinking before I left is immense. . Future reference to past problems . Ever encounter an obscure problem, solve it, and then a few months down the line you have the same problem again? Just wait for the great feeling you get when the second time the problem shows up you&#39;ve already got a solution at hand . Setting and getting to the goalpost . I sometimes lose track of what I&#39;m trying to achieve, and it helps to bring back my focus towards what I want to accomplish when I write down what I&#39;ve been doing. Likewise, setting a goal makes sure I don&#39;t stray too far from where I want to go and prevents yak shaving. . Seeing progress made . Sometimes after a long week of problem after problem, roadblocks and red tape, sweat and tears, staring at a long logbook of every challenge you&#39;ve overcome since you started with something truly revitalizes the soul, and gives you a second wind. . Venting . Let&#39;s be honest, everybody likes to complain. Especially when someone else is agreeing with your complaints, and there&#39;s no one that agrees with me more than myself. I find that a quick two sentence complaint helps me rid myself of the weight of something bothering me. Weather is cold? Complain, dress warmer, and move on. Badly designed software getting to you? Complain, take a deep breath, and realize things like Citrix are a part of life. . How I Journal . Personally I like to use jrnl.sh. Let me walk you through how I use it. . For work . When I want to write a journal entry regarding something work related, I do it using a &quot;work&quot; journal. I run jrnl work and up pops a vscode window with the following pre-made template: . txt BODY: NOTES: . This allows me to quickly pin an idea or talk about an issue. Here&#39;s an example of how I would fill it up: . txt Azure disks don&#39;t mount when instance is created BODY: @Azure is weird, and for some reason someone decided it would be a good design to not mount any virtual disks before an instance starts up, they are instead mounted after startup, resulting in &lt;current project&gt;&#39;s bootstrap section to fail. I will have to implement a check to see when the device is mounted before the script can continue. NOTES: It might be a good idea to just attach the first LUN device since the disk will always be LUN0 . looking at the latest entry: . txt ❯ jrnl work -n 1 2020-06-02 13:46 Azure disks don&#39;t mount when instance is created | BODY: | @Azure is weird, and for some reason someone decided it would be a good | design to not mount any virtual disks before an instance starts up, they are | instead mounted after startup, resulting in &lt;current project&gt;&#39;s bootstrap | section to fail. I will have to implement a check to see when the device is | mounted before the script can continue. | | NOTES: | It might be a good idea to just attach the first LUN device since the disk | will always be LUN0 . Similarly I can look for tags on things that were previously relevant: . txt ❯ jrnl life @shrimp 2020-06-02 13:51 Finally got the fishtank set up . Of course, just these text snippets don&#39;t deal it justice. It actually looks quite nice: . For life . Life journals are for every day random thoughts or ideas that I just want to not down, I don&#39;t use the template unless I find it necessary, and as such I can just use jrnl from the command line: . ❯ jrnl life Starting on msngr. Ive started working on @msngr, it should end up being a project that syncs jrnl entries to @s3, possibly other cloud storage providers. [Entry added to life journal] ❯ jrnl life -n 1 ❯ jrnl life -n 1 2020-06-02 20:25 Starting on msngr. | Ive started working on @msngr, it should end up being a project that syncs | jrnl entries to @s3, possibly other cloud storage providers. . Neat, simple, and quick. Perfect for jotting down an idea that might escape you. For those curious, you can look at the progress of msngr here . jrnl config . Here is my jrnl.yaml configuration file: . colors: body: none date: cyan tags: yellow title: blue default_hour: 9 default_minute: 0 editor: &#39;/usr/bin/code --wait&#39; encrypt: false highlight: true indent_character: &#39;|&#39; journals: default: /home/neels/.local/share/jrnl/work.txt work: /home/neels/.local/share/jrnl/work.txt play: /home/neels/.local/share/jrnl/life.txt linewrap: 79 tagsymbols: &#39;@&#39; template: &#39;/home/neels/.local/share/jrnl/template.txt&#39; timeformat: &#39;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M&#39; version: v2.4.2 . Have fun journaling! .",

            "title": "Automated Deployment of a Free Blog",
            "content": "Why do this? . My reasons for doing this are multifold, but what it boils down to are these two simple facts: . I am lazy | I don&#39;t like spending money | . I&#39;ve never had a blog so I thought I&#39;d try my hand at one. After getting some advice from a more experienced blogger, Charl, I decided to have a Hugo blog (because it&#39;s easy) hosted on Firebase (because it&#39;s free). After going through the motions I realized every time I wanted to publish a new post I&#39;d have to go through like three or four easy steps. The thing is, that&#39;s something like 25 seconds of my life I won&#39;t get back every time I make a post. So spent a few hours automating and documenting it, for maximum efficiency. . Setting everything up . Firebase . You can have up to three free projects on Google Firebase if you have a Google account, so you&#39;ll need one of those to get started. You&#39;ll also need a Hugo site ready to be deployed stored on GitHub. Once you&#39;ve got those, run npm install firebase-tools so that you can interact with firebase, then when it&#39;s finished you can run firebase login:ci to get a token that you can use later. It should look something like this: . ❯ firebase login:ci Visit this URL on this device to log in: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=563584335869-fgrhgmd47bqnekij5i8b5pr03ho849e6.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;scope=email%20openid%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcloudplatformprojects.readonly%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Ffirebase%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcloud-platform&amp;response_type=code&amp;state=166870786&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9005 Waiting for authentication... ✔ Success! Use this token to login on a CI server: thisisyourtoken-dontmakeitpublic-aliu34jnmsdfndf-r2u3rhkwjdfn Example: firebase deploy --token &quot;$FIREBASE_TOKEN&quot; . Take that token and create a GitHub secret with it, I named mine FIREBASE_TOKEN, as will be seen when we get to the next part. . In the root of your project directory run firebase init and do the following: . Select the &#39;Hosting&#39; option | Choose the project we set up earlier | Select default rules for database file | Select hugo deploy directory (public/ by default) | Say &#39;No&#39; to the single-app page question | This should create a few firebase related files, then we&#39;re all set to set up the Actions. . GitHub Actions . GitHub Actions are pretty cool. GitLab and BitBucket have been the leading git platforms with fancy tools like testing and CI/CD built into it, but recently GitHub has released Actions to also have a stake in the game. The best thing about GitHub actions is that they&#39;re completely free (for up to 2000 build minutes per month) for public repositories. . In the root of my repo, I have the directory .github/workflows/ with one file in it, deploy-hugo.yml: . name: Build &amp; deploy on: push: branches: - master jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@master - name: Get Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.2.0 with: hugo-version: &#39;latest&#39; - name: Build static files run: hugo --gc --minify --cleanDestinationDir - name: Deploy to Firebase uses: w9jds/firebase-action@master with: args: deploy --only hosting --project blog-neels-tech env: FIREBASE_TOKEN: $ . Let&#39;s break that down . name: Build &amp; deploy on: push: branches: - master jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest . What the above does, is whenever there&#39;s a new push to master, a bunch of tasks will be run on a clean ubuntu container. . steps: - uses: actions/checkout@master . Get the current repo&#39;s master branch using the checkout action. . - name: Get Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.2.0 with: hugo-version: &#39;latest&#39; - name: Build static files run: hugo --gc --minify --cleanDestinationDir . Get the Hugo Setup Action module and then use it to create the static files for hugo to serve, and finally, . - name: Deploy to Firebase uses: w9jds/firebase-action@master with: args: deploy --only hosting --project blog-neels-tech env: FIREBASE_TOKEN: $ . Deploy to Firebase with the token we generated earlier. . In conclusion . Whenever you want to create a new post, just run hugo new posts/tech-stuff.md and commit/push your changes when done, the rest will be handled for you :D .",
